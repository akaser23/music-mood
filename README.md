# music-mood

# Concept Description
As lovers of music and a stiff drink, we wanted to build a mood music application that could make suggestions for a cozy rainy night in or a summer evening with friends. 
# User Description
As a USER, I want to be provided a playlist of songs, and a cocktail based on my current weather conditions. 
GIVEN a page to imput a city name
WHEN I search for a city 
THEN I am presented with a spotify playlist to match that cities weather and a cocktail with a specific liquor type to match that cities weather. 
# Challeneges
Our first concept was to create just a music playlist depending on the weather and print the artist information that is currently playing to the side of the playlist. But, since embedded iframes make it hard to isolate certain elements, we had to think of something new. However, this work around gave the app and the user more to work with. What we eneded up creating had more than just music it had a drink as well.
